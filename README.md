******* Elgg News Plugin *******

Free Elgg plugin for post news and announcements by administrators and group owners.

This plugin offers admins the options:
1. Post news items
2. Add other Elgg entities as news items
3. Option to determine more users who can post news/announcements

As an example for 2nd case, if there is blog post by any user, administrator can add this as news post. So it will be displayed in list of news but if users click on this item, will redirected to original blog post. The same action could apply to any post like pages, bookmarks, videos etc. 

Also administrator can allow to group owners for posting new/announcements inside the group only.
